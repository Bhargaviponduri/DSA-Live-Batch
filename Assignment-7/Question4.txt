4. An almost sorted array is given to us and the task is to sort that array completely. Then,
which sorting algorithm would you prefer and why?[Salesforce]

We will be using Insertion sort for almost sorted array
because as it is almost sorted we will be having less number of comparisons and less number of swaps
Timecomplexity of sorting : no.of swaps+no.of comparisons
which is (depend on the array)+n-1=> n=>O(n)
